            <h1>   About Me </h1>
            I Am 22 years old and am currently located in Rochester NY. I began attending University at Buffalo in Fall 2014 majoring in Chemical Engineering, and pursued that degree for 3 years until I ultimately decided to change majors to Computer Science. I changed majors because I enjoyed and excelled at problem solving and mathematics and had more interest in the programming aspect of my studies so far. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in the spring of 2019 and currently am seeking employment. Currently I have experience with a wide variety of languages and applications but have the most experience with Java, C++, and Python. In addition embedded systems, data analysis, machine learning and general software development are my favorite fields of study. 
            I believe due to my many years of experience in leadership roles, and participation in various tasks requiring collaboration with peers, has made me a valuable asset to help enhance cohesion and productivity at a company.
